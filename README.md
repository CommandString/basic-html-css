# Basic HTML / CSS
This is just a very basic HTML / CSS project. I was bored and decided to try buidling a basic website template with my own CSS instead of Fomantic-UI and templating engines. Also is nice for those who want to learn HTML / CSS and want to see how a basic html site is made.

# What Exists so far?
* A very basic grid
* Hero section
* Buttons
* Navigation bar
